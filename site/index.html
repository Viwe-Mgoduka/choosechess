									<p>A German study indicated that when chess players
									were asked to identify chess positions and geometric 
									shapes, both the left and right hemispheres of the 
									brain became highly active. Their reaction times to the 
									simple shapes were the same, but the experts were 
									using both sides of their brains to more quickly 
									respond to the chess position questions.</p>

									<p>Do smart people play chess, or does

									a person’s IQ. 
									A study of 4,000 Venezuelan students 
									produced significant rises in the IQ 
									scores of both boys and girls after 
									four months of chess instruction. 
									So grab a chess board and improve

									<p>As we age, it becomes increasingly important to give 
									the brain a workout, just as you would every other 
									major muscle group, in order to keep it healthy and fit.
									A recent study featured in The New England Journal 
									of Medicine found that people over 75 who engage in 
									brain-games like chess are less likely to develop 
									dementia than their non-board-game-playing peers. 
									The saying “use it or lose it” certainly applies here, as 
									a sedentary brain can decrease brain power. All the 
									more reason to play chess before you turn 75.</p>

									<p>In an oft-cited 1991 study, Dr. Stuart

									program and evaluated them compared 
									to non-chess-playing students in the 
									district and around the country. 
									He found definitive results that playing

									<p>One of the last parts of the brain to

									prefrontal cortex development and helps 
									teenagers make better decisions in all 
									areas of life, perhaps keeping them from 
									making an irresponsible, risky choice.</p>

									Good chess players have exceptional memory

									<p>Chess develops fine motor skills in individuals who 
									have disability or have suffered a stroke or other 
									physically debilitating accident. This form of 
									rehabilitation requires the motion of chess pieces 
									in different directions (forward, backward, 
									diagonally forward motion, 
									diagonally backward motion), which can help develop 
									and fine tune a patient’s motor skills, while the 
									mental effort required to play the game can improve 
									cognitive and communication skills. Playing can also 
									stimulate deep concentration and calm, helping to 
									center and relax patients who are experiencing 
									different degrees of anxiety.</p>
